Smart Phi is a project created by the Mexican company Phi Tu Asesor en Soluciones in collaboration with the ECAFE development group in the USA.
The main objective is to explore and develop new technological tools in order to evolve the insurance and pension industry. Through the implementation of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, sovereign identity and blockchain. To help reduce transaction time and cost.
We are developing algorithms for calculating expenses, reserves and their impact on the cost of products in order to estimate an appropriate price for each user.
Due to the high development of the Tron network, we decided to implement the applications in this network. Being part of the partners representing the Tron network is the way we show our confidence in this project. With the support of the community we hope to continue developing this project.
